Passionate about technology and programming. Always looking to improve myself more and more in the area of development and seeking continuous evolution every day.

I want to change people's lives through programming. I really like to add value to my projects, generate results, make life easier as people through programming - this is something that inspires me a lot and I feel very good about being able to build or are participating in something that will add to people's lives.
I'm tied to the idea of project patterns and clean code - it's keeping organized what I'm interested in learning and making code easier to develop and understand.

I keep improving myself in Web and Mobile Development.
I recently started my studies with React Native and I'm currently working on some projects with this language.

I am currently studying:
